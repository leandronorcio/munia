## About this project

This project is an open source portfolio project that explores how can a social media app be built with Next.js.

It utilizes the following Next.js features:

- routing
- static and dynamic rendering
- server and client components
- nested layouts
- route handlers
- middleware
- partial pre-rendering
- font optimizations
- dynamic metadata

Due to the highly dynamic nature of social media apps, most data fetching and mutations are done on the client-side using React Query.

React Query simplifies the implementation of features that would have been challenging and inefficient with Next.js's server components and server actions. These features include bidirectional infinite scrolling, optimistic updates, client-side data caching, client-side loading states, and more.

## Accessibility

The UI components are built with React Aria's accessibility hooks, assuring accessibility across different platforms.
